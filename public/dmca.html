    Notification of Infringement
  </h2>
  <h3 class="text">
    It is our policy to respond to clear notices of
    alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium
    Copyright Act. In addition, we will promptly terminate without notice
    the accounts of those determined by us to be &quot;repeat
    infringers&quot;. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and
    you believe that any content hosted on our web site
    (www.AngelThump.com) infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a
    notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
    (&quot;DMCA&quot;) by providing AngelThump.com&#039;s Designated
    Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (please
    consult your legal counsel or see 17 U.S.C. Section 512(c)(3) to
    confirm these requirements):
    <ul>
      <li class="list">
        A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on
        behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
        infringed.
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed,
        or, if multiple copyrighted works on the AngelThump.com web site are
        covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works
        at that site.
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to
        be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or
        access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably
        sufficient to permit AngelThump.com to locate the material. Providing a
        broadcaster's feed and the time on such feed at which you believe there
        has been an infringement is the best way to help us locate content
        quickly.
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        Information reasonably sufficient to permit AngelThump.com to contact
        you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an
        electronic mail address at which you may be contacted.
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the
        material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright
        owner, its agent, or the law.
      </li>
      <li class="list">
        A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and
        under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of
        the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who
    knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is
    infringing may be subject to liability. 
    <br><br>

    Please note that AngelThump.com may, at our discretion, send a copy of
    such notices to a third-party for publication. As such, your letter
    (with personal information removed) may be forwarded to Chilling
    Effects (<a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org" rel="nofollow"
    target="_blank">www.chillingeffects.org</a>) for publication.
