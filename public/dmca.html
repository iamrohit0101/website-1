        <h3><span style='color: #4b4133'>Digital Millennium Copyright Act
        Notification Guidelines</span></h3>
        <h3><span style='color: #4b4133'>Notification of
        Infringement</span></h3>It is our policy to respond to clear notices of
        alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium
        Copyright Act. In addition, we will promptly terminate without notice
        the accounts of those determined by us to be &quot;repeat
        infringers&quot;. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and
        you believe that any content hosted on our web site
        (www.AngelThump.com) infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a
        notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
        (&quot;DMCA&quot;) by providing AngelThump.com&#039;s Designated
        Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (please
        consult your legal counsel or see 17 U.S.C. Section 512(c)(3) to
        confirm these requirements):<br>
        <br>
        - A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on
        behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
        infringed.<br>
        Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed,
        or, if multiple copyrighted works on the AngelThump.com web site are
        covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works
        at that site.<br>
        - Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to
        be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or
        access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably
        sufficient to permit AngelThump.com to locate the material. Providing a
        broadcaster's feed and the time on such feed at which you believe there
        has been an infringement is the best way to help us locate content
        quickly.<br>
        - Information reasonably sufficient to permit AngelThump.com to contact
        you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an
        electronic mail address at which you may be contacted.<br>
        - A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the
        material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright
        owner, its agent, or the law.<br>
        - A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and
        under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of
        the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.<br>
        <br>
        Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who
        knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is
        infringing may be subject to liability.<br>
        <br>
        Please note that AngelThump.com may, at our discretion, send a copy of
        such notices to a third-party for publication. As such, your letter
        (with personal information removed) may be forwarded to Chilling
        Effects (<a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org" rel="nofollow"
        target="_blank">www.chillingeffects.org</a>) for publication.<br>
        <br>
        <h3><span style='color: #4b4133'>Counter-Notification</span></h3>If you
        elect to send us a counter notice, to be effective it must be a written
        communication that includes the following (please consult your legal
        counsel or see 17 U.S.C. Section 512(g)(3) to confirm these
        requirements):<br>
        <br>
        - Your physical or electronic signature.<br>
        - Identification of the material that has been removed or to which
        access has been disabled and the location at which the material
        appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.<br>
        - A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith
        belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake
        or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.<br>
        - The subscriber's name, address, and telephone number, and a statement
        that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the
        judicial district in which the address is located, or if your address
        is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which
        AngelThump.com may be found, and that you will accept service of
        process from the person who provided notification under subsection
        (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.<br>
        <br>
        Please note that under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act, any person
        who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was
        removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to
        liability.<br>
